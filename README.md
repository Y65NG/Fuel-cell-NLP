# Supplementary Materials for "Natural Language Processing Applied on Large Scale Data Extraction from Scientific Papers in Fuel Cells"

This repo hosts relevant codes for the article "Natural Language Processing Applied on Large Scale Data Extraction from Scientific Papers in Fuel Cells". We focus on the process of NLP --- including text acquisition, text preprocessing, word embedding training, and named entity recognition --- applied on 106,181 abstracts of fuel cell papers. Then we evaluate our trained model on its ability of analogy, using the model to analyze the trend in fuel cell materials and predict new materials.

## Set up
Make sure you have `python3.6` and the `pip` module installed. We recommend using [conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
